# Brownie
Drop in Cookie disclaimer bar

##What is this?
Web developers are required by E.U law to disclaim to end users that our code is using cookies on their machine. Brownie makes this 
simple. Brownie is a JS and CSS file that any dev can drop into a web application, it is designed to be unobtrusive but still very clear to end users. 

##What does Brownie do?
Brownie checks to see if user's have accepted cookies on this site before, by using cookies, if there is no previous acceptance Cookie made by Brownie it creates a full width and fixed html <aside> banner on your page which offers the end user the options to read up on EU cookie laws or just accept the cookies and closes the Brownie banner. Accepting the cookies creates a cookie to stop it being shown next time that browser loads your page.
